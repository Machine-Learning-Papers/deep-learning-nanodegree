# Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree

My implementation of projects in Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree (DLND).

Thanks to Udacity, I was brought into the world of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence throughout the program. These projects though tiny were carefully designed and offered me the primary hands-on experience.

You want to learn something, just do it. You do it, then you learn it!

## Dependencies
Each directory has a requirements.txt describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments
You can find Conda environment files in the environments folder. Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with tensorflow-gpu are labeled in the filename with "GPU".

## Collection of Projects

### 1. Your First Neural Network
Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.

### 2. Image Classification
Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.

### 3. Text Generation
Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.

### 4. Machine Translation
Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)

### 5. Face Generation
Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
